# Next.js Link Component Navigation Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue with the Next.js Link component where navigation to a new route fails to work correctly. The problem is related to how the Link component interacts with the routing system in specific circumstances.

## Description
The provided code snippet shows a basic implementation of the Next.js Link component.  Despite seemingly correct usage, clicking the link does not result in the expected page transition to `/profile`. This issue can arise from various scenarios like incorrect routing configuration, improper use of the Link component within specific contexts (e.g., inside a custom component), or issues with the Next.js environment setup.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
4. Click the 'Go to Profile' link. Observe that it doesn't navigate to the /profile page.

## Solution
The solution involves addressing potential issues in routing configuration, checking for errors in the target route, ensuring the existence of the profile page and its correct configuration in `pages/profile.js`, and confirming that the Link component is correctly used within the intended context.  Additionally, it's essential to debug the application to rule out environmental issues or conflicts with other libraries or custom logic.
